# Boiler Book Club

The [Boiler Book Club](https://www.boilerbookclub.com) is Purdue's largest collection of readers! This repository serves as the central hub of various applications written to support the club. Please note that development is limited to members; to join the club, follow instructions as presented on the website.

Currently, development is maintained by the club's Communication Officer, Kai Tinkess, and Treasurer, Matt Headley. If you would like to contribute or have an idea for a project, please contact one of them or the President.

Also note that the website was built using Squarespace and we are not interested in migrating it presently. Supporting the website is one of the responsibilites of the Communication Committee.
